  about: |
    If you have a usage question or an error rather than a specific
    bug report, Stack Overflow might be the better place for that.
    There's a somewhat active community here so you will probably get
    a solution quicker. And also there is a large amount of already
    resolved questions which can help too! Just remember to put the `geopy`
    tag if you'd decide to open a question.

  about: |
    GitHub Discussions is
    a good place to start if Stack Overflow didn't help or you have
    some idea or a feature request you'd like to bring up, or if you
    just have trouble and not sure you're doing everything right.
    Solutions and helpful snippets/patterns are also very welcome here.
