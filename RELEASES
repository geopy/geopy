0.95.1 - March 22, 2013
==========
FIXED:   Fix #12, where `DeprecationWarning` was showing for GoogleV2 even if
         it wasn't being used (due to `geopy.geocoders` importing it).
         Contributed by Dave Arter.

CHANGED: `GoogleV3.geocode` "address" kwarg renamed to "string" to match
         `Google.geocode` to make updating easier.

FIXED:   Geocoders now properly handle Unicode objects as input (previously
         would fail on non-ASCII characters due to wanting UTF-8 strings).

0.95 - March 12, 2013
==========
ADDED:   Google Geocoding API V3 support. Contributed by Jordan Bouvier
         (jbouvier). "google.Google()" should be replaced by
         "googlev3.GoogleV3()", with no `api_key`.

         Please see http://goo.gl/somDT for valid arguments.

UPDATED: setup.py updated to now automatically support Python 3+ (via 2to3
         auto-compile option). Contributed by Feanil Patel.

0.94.2 - March 12, 2012
==========
ADDED:   MANIFEST.in so that LICENSE file gets included in dist packages
         (per req by Debian Python Module Team)

UPDATED: Yahoo geocoder uses new PlaceFinder API instead of outdated MapsService
         V1 API.

0.94.1 - March 24, 2011
==========
ADDED:   Test suite includes geocoding tests for the Google, Bing, Yahoo,
         GeocoderDotUS, and GeoNames geocoders.

CHANGED: `output_format` is deprecated in backends that used it.

FIXED:   Bing geocoder now works properly. Updated to use the JSON return
         method rather than XML. `output_format` has always been ignored
         and is now deprecated.

FIXED:   GeocoderDotUS now works properly. Updated to use more compact CSV
         return method rather than XMLRPC.

CHANGED: Yahoo geocoder now uses the "old" tuple return format
         (address, (lat, lon)) rather than the undocumented Location()
         object, for API consistency. (Object return values with rich
         data will be implemented in a future release.)

FIXED:   Issue 40. Fixed "print" statement in Bing backend. No more
         print statements remain.

FIXED:   Issue 39. In addition to checking for system `json` and `simplejson`,
         geopy now looks for a system-installed `django` (which bundles a
         copy of simplejson).

FIXED:   Issue 45. Implement __cmp__ on Distance so that distance objects may
         be compared against one another.

CHANGED: Added __repr__ and __str__ to Distance

ADDED:   Issue 46. Geocoder backend for MapQuest's OpenMapQuest API, contributed
         by Shashwat Anand.

0.94 - March 7, 2010
====================
ADDED: Partial test suite can now be run via "setup.py test"

FIXED: Issue 5. Converted "print" statements to logger calls to
       allow compatibility with WSGI.

FIXED: Issue 16. Google geocoder backend now throws more descriptive
       exceptions on certain failure statuses.

FIXED: Issue 18. Add simplejson to install_requires for setup. Use
       native (Python 2.6+/3.0+) json module if available.

FIXED: Issue 21 and Issue 25. Distance calculations for values beyond
       180/-180 and 90/-90 now wrap instead of raising an error.

FIXED: Issue 22. Fixed string representation of Point objects so
       that they don't throw an exception.

FIXED: Issue 23. Fixed GreatCircleDistance ValueErrors due to floating
       point precision on extremely close points.

Changes between 0.93 (October 8, 2006) and February 15, 2009
