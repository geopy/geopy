0.95 - TBD
==========
ADDED:   Test suite includes geocoding tests for the Google, Bing, and
         Yahoo geocoders.

CHANGED: `output_format` is deprecated in backends that used it.

FIXED:   Bing geocoder now works properly. Updated to use the JSON return
         method rather than XML. `output_format` has always been ignored
         and is now deprecated.

CHANGED: Yahoo geocoder now uses the "old" tuple return format
         (address, (lat, lon)) rather than the undocumented Location()
         object, for API consistency. (Object return values with rich
         data will be implemented in a future release.)

FIXED:   Issue 40. Fixed "print" statement in Bing backend. No more
         print statements remain.

0.94 - March 7, 2010
====================
ADDED: Partial test suite can now be run via "setup.py test"

FIXED: Issue 5. Converted "print" statements to logger calls to
       allow compatibility with WSGI.

FIXED: Issue 16. Google geocoder backend now throws more descriptive
       exceptions on certain failure statuses.

FIXED: Issue 18. Add simplejson to install_requires for setup. Use
       native (Python 2.6+/3.0+) json module if available.

FIXED: Issue 21 and Issue 25. Distance calculations for values beyond
       180/-180 and 90/-90 now wrap instead of raising an error.

FIXED: Issue 22. Fixed string representation of Point objects so
       that they don't throw an exception.

FIXED: Issue 23. Fixed GreatCircleDistance ValueErrors due to floating
       point precision on extremely close points.
